# Geomechanical-properties-through-ML-algorithms-


## Objectives
Adequate knowledge of the Geomechanical Properties before drilling plays a major role in safe drilling, recovery well design, and enhanced recovery. This study investigates the field of the Niger Delta Basin which frequently encounters unconsolidated reservoirs and overpressured shales. We present a well-log scale 1D geomechanical model and a data-driven technique for predicting the minimum horizontal stress in five wells located in the Eocene Agbada Formation of the Niger Delta.

This repo contains Jupyter notebooks to estimate Geomechanical properties through ML algorithms for accurate determination and prediction of Horizontal Stress. The workflow is typical for any similiar project and it entails: • Wrangle and process the data to the desired format; • Carry out quick look and statistical analysis of the well log data; • Develop desired machine learning models; and • Deploy the model and investigate its performance.

## Data Source
The data used in this study was from the Niger delta Basin and was provided by TOTAL E&P Nigeria, 

## Implementation
Software: `Python`

Packages: `lasio`, `sklearn`, `numpy`, `pandas` and `matplotlib`

The various manipulations and operations on the well logs is done by running the jupyter notebook called` Geomechanical_Log_pred.ipnyb`.
