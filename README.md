Geomechanical properties through ML algorithms for accurate determination and prediction of Horizontal Stress

## Objectives


## Data Source
The data used in this study was from the Niger delta Basin and was provided by TOTAL E&P Nigeria, 

## Implementation
Software: --Python--

Packages: lasio, sklearn, numpy, pandas and matplotlib

The various manipulations and operations on the well logs is done by running the jupyter notebook called Well_Log_Editting.ipnyb and Well_Log_Formatting.ipnyb.

The ML_Models_X.ipnyb is the notebook where the models are built, trained and deployed.
